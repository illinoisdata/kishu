Installation
========================
`Kishu <https://pypi.org/project/kishu/>`_ and its `JupyterLab extension <https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-kishu/>`_ can be installed directly from PyPi:

.. code-block:: console

  pip install jupyterlab_kishu kishu

Installing Kishu will also install jupyterlab into your environment. You will see an additional Kishu tab in the JupyterLab toolbar upon (re-)starting your JupyterLab instance if installation succeeds:
