{
  //the histories in the "Histories" list are in breadth-first order according to the git graph. e.g.
  //the git graph of the following histories is like this:

  //  1004
  //    |
  //  1003
  //    |
  //  1002  1020
  //    |   /
  //  1000

  //1. althouth the history 1020 is created after history 1003 and 1004, it is shown before
  // history 1003 and 1004 in the "Histories" list.

  //2. if a commit has more than one child (i.e. a
  //new branch is created on that commit, like commit 1000), then the child on the
  //same branch of the parent commit(e.g. 1002) must occur after the child
  //in the newly created branch(e.g. 1020)
  //Thus, 1002 also must be shown after 1020 in the "Histories" list, although they are siblings!
